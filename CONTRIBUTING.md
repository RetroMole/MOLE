# Contributing to MOLE
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Platforms we use
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, track our project roadmaps, as well as accept pull requests, but there are other platforms in use aswell:
- Azure Pipelines for automatically building, testing and releasing.
- Heroku to host APIs and WebApps.

## Any contributions you make will be under the GNU General Public License v3.0
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [GNU v3.0 License](/LICENSE.md) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.
By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the projects GNU v3.0 License.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](../../issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs, however some major bugs that need to be fixed before a certain release may be found in the "Bugs" collumn of our [project](../..//projects).
Report a bug by [opening a new issue](../../issues/new/choose).

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
* Basically all the default styiling in VS19. The "Messages" tab of the Error List should always be empty if possible.
* Use XML /// comments for any methods, properties, classes, namespaces, etc... regardless of their access modifiers as the final XML files are used in the [wiki](../../wiki) for documentation.
