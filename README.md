This tool was created to make SMW hacking easier by combining the functionality of Lunar Magic with that of some essential Rom Hacking tools into a single reliable tool, taking away the pain of having 20 folders filled with tools to edit or insert stuff into the ROM, it's now all in one place!

You can find a lot of useful information about MOLE, Lunar Magic, SMW Romhacking, and SNES development in general, on [SMW Central](https://www.smwcentral.net/) and the (COMING SOON) MOLE [Wiki](https://github.com/Vawlpe/MOLE-Mario-wOrLd-Editor/wiki).
